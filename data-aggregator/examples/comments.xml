						               													<description>Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.

The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.

The depth here is comparable to many wargames, but the game is more subtle in that the means to reach your goal (winning) aren't nearly as clear as attack and win.

Great game, with many mechanics, and the understanding of all are relevant to success.  I love that the game offers several strategies, and that one can, and should, decide among current focus, and future strength.  Although, some limited success in current rounds is often necessary to win, so one can't completely abandon current play.

In our game, the only person not to form coallitions won the game, but I think that the result was more a matter of the group not attacking the player, but that's another great asspect of the game, - the politics and the social engineering matter." />

			<comment username="SpielGeld" rating="N/A" value="It think after playing this once I can dub this &quot;The King of Euros&quot;.  There are so many mechanics but they are all blended very well into the game.  It's took several rounds for me to begin to appriciate how the game plays and as we were lucky enough to be able to play the game in three hours the game the length seemed appropriate.  At least know I can say I've played it and would gladly join in another game if invited.  I would like to play this a couple of more times before giving it a rating though but at this point I'm pretty sure I can say this IS better than Caylus or Puetro Rico." />

			<comment username="Starsunsky" rating="N/A" value="[Moskito Spiel 2nd Edition] {German politic, economic; blind-bidding, bidding, variable-player-order, area-control} Die Macher is a very heavy game.  Players need a very good long-term planning to win.  Player interaction is very good in either cooperative (coalition) or competitive (getting media controls, etc.).  Replayability is very good - each game is different.  I am happy to own this game.

However, it is not easy to teach this game effectively without a round of sample play.  And, it needs some time to understand the game; esp. to understand the use of shadow cabinet and opinion pool cards.

The game component is effectively.  The German cards don't interfere the game play much.  It needs a large table space.

			<comment username="kuhrusty" rating="N/A" value="I was so excited to see VG reprinting this, I pre-ordered it without really considering the fact that my friends will probably never play it.

The comic-book font used in the rules, combined with the, uhh, Canadian? writing style, makes this painful to read.  &quot;Unfortunately, a game of this complexity requires more than a page or two of rules to describe it and much of the rules include pictures and step-by-step examples to ensure ease of understanding the game flow.&quot;  Gargghh!!  Semicolon!  However!  Comma!

Update: after running through a turn solo to figure out how to play, I think A) instead of actually trying to explain the game to new players, you're probably better off just running all the way through a turn without anyone knowing what they're doing, then starting over for real, and B) after they play through a turn, I'm not sure anyone I know is actually going to want to play this!  We'll see, though.

[i]And,[/i] the comment above about the rulebook being painful to read is perhaps a bit overblown.  The first impression is not great, but the rulebook really isn't that bad.

2015-04-21: succumbed to the reality that this game will [i]never hit the table[/i] except in tear-blurred solo learning games; traded for a game about zombies." />
